The problem is related to the shortest job next with priority.
Shortest job next means the process with the shortest burst time will be selected
first for the execution from the ready queue and also if two processes have the same burst time 
then it will work as FCFS.In this problem the processor will also check priority before
the burst time if ssame then only burst time.When the process arrives in a ready queue it get 
executed and if the second arrives it checks the priority and if same then burst time of previous and get accordingly arranged. 
As it is non-preemptive so no process will overlap the next process will wait for the completion of currently running process.
